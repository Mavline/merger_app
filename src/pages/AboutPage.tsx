          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          
          <h3>1. Horizontal Merging (Main)</h3>
          <p>
            The core functionality allows comparing and merging two Excel files based on key fields (such as part numbers). The process includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Uploading two Excel files</li>
            <li>Selecting sheets from each file</li>
            <li>Choosing columns to include in the result</li>
            <li>Defining key fields for row matching</li>
            <li>Merging data while preserving Excel grouping structure</li>
            <li>Highlighting non-matching rows with markers in the "Note" column</li>
            <li>Expanding ranges in selected columns (e.g., "A1-A5" â†’ "A1,A2,A3,A4,A5")</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Vertical Merging</h3>
          <p>
            Additional functionality for vertical concatenation of multiple BOM (Bill of Materials) files:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Uploading multiple Excel files</li>
            <li>Vertically combining data (rows from all files are added sequentially)</li>
            <li>Adding a "BOM" column with the source file name to track data origin</li>
            <li>Removing grouping columns (Level_*)</li>
            <li>Creating a unified table with all data</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="about-section">
          <h2>Data Processing Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Grouping Structure Processing</strong> - preserves hierarchical data structure from Excel, including grouping levels</li>
            <li><strong>Range Processing</strong> - ability to expand ranges in "A1-A5" format into individual values</li>
            <li><strong>Intelligent Header Detection</strong> - automatic identification of header rows in Excel files</li>
            <li><strong>Duplicate Handling</strong> - removal of duplicate rows during merging</li>
            <li><strong>Discrepancy Marking</strong> - highlighting rows that have no matches in the second file</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section className="about-section">
          <h2>Data Export</h2>
          <p>
            The application allows exporting merged results to a new Excel file with preserved formatting:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Header styling (background color, bold font)</li>
            <li>Column width adjustment based on content</li>
            <li>Cell border addition</li>
            <li>Preservation of grouping structure in the output file</li>
          </ul>
